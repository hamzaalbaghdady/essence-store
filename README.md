# essence-store

Essence is a Collection Dresses store i get the front end template for free from Colorlib, distributed by ThemeWagon and the dashboard from HTML Codex Distributed By ThemeWagon and i did all the backend work using PHP and MySQL database.

## This project is a full stack ecommerce website that have tow parts:

- user home pages: store pages {index.php, shop.php, login.php, ...}
- Admin home page (dashboard): which have all pages to control the website like: {addCaegory.php, editProduct.php, deleteUser.php, ...}

### After 2 days of work i finished modifing the front end files i well start the real work now :)

## issues:

- There is a lot of work in javascript that i can't do, its all about the look and it may make it easyer to the user so if you can work on it that will be great.
  \*\* the problems exist in the add and edit files.
